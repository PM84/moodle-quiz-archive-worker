Quiz archiver service to work in conjunction with the Moodle plugin
[quiz_archiver](https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-quiz_archiver).

This application processes quiz archive jobs. It renders Moodle quiz attempts
inside a headless webbrowser and exports them to PDFs and HTMLs. Moodle backups
can optionally be included in the generated archive. The checksum for each file
within the archive as well as the checksum of the archive itself is calculated
to allow integrity checks.


# Installation

You can install this application in several ways, however, the easiest and
preferred way is to use [Docker Compose](#docker-compose).

## Docker Compose

3. Switch into the repository directory: `cd moodle-quiz-archive-worker`
4. Run the application: `docker-compose up`

You can change the host port by replacing the first port number in the `ports`
argument and configuration values by setting the respective `environment`
variables inside `docker-compose.yml`. For more details and all available
configuration parameters see [Configuration](#configuration).

### Running the application in the background
